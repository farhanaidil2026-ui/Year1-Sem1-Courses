## 🎯 Personal Takeaways

### What I Learned

This course opened my eyes to how deeply corruption affects society—from weakening economies to eroding public trust. I gained insight into Malaysia's legal mechanisms and institutional efforts to promote transparency and accountability. Beyond the classroom discussions, I've come to understand that integrity isn't just about following rules; it's about making principled choices even when no one is watching.

### Core Lessons

**Ethics in Action**  
Technical expertise alone won't define my career success. This course reinforced that ethical conduct must guide every decision I make, whether in coding projects, team collaborations, or future workplace scenarios.

**Room for Growth**  
While the lectures were informative, I believe the course could benefit from more hands-on learning approaches. Case study analyses, simulation exercises, or even guest speakers from anti-corruption agencies would help students connect abstract concepts to real-world situations more effectively.

## 🌟 Final Thoughts

Completing ULRS1032 has been more than fulfilling an academic requirement—it's been a character-building experience. The knowledge I've gained about ethical responsibility will influence how I approach my career in data engineering and beyond. I now recognize that creating a corruption-free society starts with individual commitment to integrity, and I'm motivated to carry these principles forward in all aspects of my life.
