## 📋 Course Details

**Course Code:** SECJ1013  
**Instructor:** Dr. Luqman Bin Mohd Shafie  
**Section:** 02  
**Student:** Muhammad Aidil Farhan

### What This Course Is About

This is my first real dive into programming using C++. The course taught me how to write, test, and debug programs from scratch. Through plenty of hands-on exercises and projects, I developed better analytical thinking and problem-solving skills. The fundamentals I picked up here are going to be the foundation for all my future programming work.

## 🎯 My Learning Journey

### What I Gained

This course taught me how to approach problems systematically using C++. I learned the importance of building solid algorithms, using conditions and loops to control program flow, and organizing code properly with functions. The whole process of writing and debugging programs really trained me to be more patient and pay attention to details, one missing semicolon can break everything!

### Personal Development

**Sense of Achievement**  
There's this really satisfying feeling when a program you've been struggling with finally runs correctly. By the end of the semester, I could write programs that handle data, perform various operations, and actually solve real problems. That progression from "Hello World" to building functional applications was pretty rewarding.

**Technical Skills Built**
- Breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps
- Writing clean, organized code using functions
- Working with arrays and pointers (which was challenging at first)
- Debugging
- Understanding how data structures work

## 💡 Course Effectiveness

### What Worked

The hands-on approach made all the difference. You can't really learn programming by just watching or reading, you have to actually code. The exercises and assignments pushed me to apply concepts immediately after learning them, which helped everything stick better.

### Areas for Improvement

I think the course could be even better with:
- More collaborative projects where students work in teams
- Additional practice problems for trickier topics like pointers
- Maybe some coding competitions to make learning more engaging
- Real-world application examples showing how these concepts are used in actual software

## 🌟 Final Thoughts

SECJ1013 has given me a solid foundation in programming that I'll build on throughout my degree. The logical reasoning and problem-solving approach I developed here aren't just useful for coding, they're applicable to pretty much any technical challenge I'll face. As someone heading toward data engineering, understanding how to manipulate data structures and write efficient algorithms is crucial, and this course set me up well for that path.

Programming can be frustrating at times, but there's something deeply satisfying about making a computer do exactly what you want it to do.
