## 🧠 Learning Experience

### Knowledge Gained

Digital Logic opened my eyes to what happens beneath the software layer. Understanding how binary digits flow through logic gates to perform calculations gave me newfound appreciation for computer architecture. The progression from simple AND/OR gates to complex sequential circuits showed me how sophisticated systems emerge from basic building blocks.

**Practical Skills Developed:**
- Circuit design and optimization using Boolean algebra
- Truth table construction and analysis
- Implementing combinational and sequential logic
- Troubleshooting digital circuit behavior

### Personal Growth

**Problem-Solving Enhancement**  
Working through circuit simplification challenges sharpened my logical reasoning. Each problem required breaking down complex systems into manageable parts—a skill directly applicable to my future work in data engineering.

**Hardware-Software Connection**  
This course bridged the gap between abstract programming concepts and physical hardware reality. Understanding how data moves through registers and counters helps me write more efficient code, knowing what's happening at the machine level.

## 💡 Looking Forward

### What Worked Well

The laboratory sessions were invaluable. Physically building circuits and watching LEDs respond to logic inputs transformed abstract theory into tangible understanding. The hands-on approach made complex topics like flip-flops and shift registers much clearer.

### Suggestions for Enhancement

Future iterations of this course could benefit from:
- More simulation software practice (like Logisim or CircuitVerse)
- Real-world application examples from modern processors
- Mini-projects that combine multiple modules into one comprehensive design
