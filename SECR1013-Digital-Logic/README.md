## 📋 Course Details

**Course Code:** SECR1013  
**Instructor:** Mr. Ahmad Fariz Bin Ali  
**Section:** 02  
**Student:** Muhammad Aidil Farhan

### Course Description

Digital Logic is all about understanding how computers actually work at the hardware level. We learned how computers use binary (0s and 1s), logic gates, and circuits to process information. The course covered Boolean algebra and circuit design, which helped us figure out how to build and understand the actual physical parts that make computers run.

## 🧠 Learning Experience

### Knowledge Gained

Taking Digital Logic really changed how I see computers. Before this, I only thought about software and coding, but now I understand what's actually happening inside the machine. Learning how binary numbers move through logic gates to do calculations was honestly pretty cool. Seeing how you can start with simple AND and OR gates and build them up into complicated circuits that can count, store data, and do all sorts of stuff was mind-blowing.

**Skills I Picked Up:**
- Designing circuits and making them simpler using Boolean algebra
- Creating and reading truth tables
- Building both combinational and sequential logic circuits
- Figuring out why circuits aren't working the way they should

### Personal Growth

**Better Problem-Solving**  
The circuit simplification problems really helped me get better at thinking logically. Every problem was like a puzzle where you had to break down something complicated into smaller, easier pieces. That's definitely going to help me when I'm working with data engineering stuff later on.

**Connecting the Dots**  
This course was the bridge I needed between the code I write and what's actually happening in the hardware. Now when I'm coding, I have a better idea of how my data is moving through registers and counters inside the computer. It makes me think more about writing efficient code because I know what's going on behind the scenes.

## 💡 Looking Forward

### What Worked Well

The lab sessions were definitely the best part. Actually building circuits with real components and seeing LEDs light up when you get the logic right made everything click. It's one thing to learn about flip-flops and shift registers on paper, but when you physically wire them up and see them work, it just makes way more sense.

### Suggestions for Enhancement

I think future classes could be even better with:
- More time using simulation software like Logisim or CircuitVerse
- Examples showing how these concepts are used in actual modern processors
- Bigger projects where we combine everything we learned into one cool design

## 🎓 Closing Reflection

SECR1013 was super important for building my computer science foundation. Since I want to go into data engineering, knowing how data is actually stored and processed at the hardware level gives me a much better understanding of everything. The logical thinking and systematic approach to solving problems that I learned here will definitely stick with me through university and my future career.

Even though we live in a world where everyone's focused on software and apps, this course showed me that understanding hardware is still really important if you want to be serious about computer science.
