## 🎯 Course Impact

### Academic Growth

This course really changed how I think about technology in professional settings. The chapters on databases and data analytics especially caught my attention since I'm interested in data engineering. I can now see how proper data architecture is crucial for any meaningful analysis. The system design principles taught me to look at the bigger picture and understand how different IT components work together to solve business problems.

### Memorable Experiences

**🔧 PC Assembly Workshop**  
The hands-on PC assembly lab was definitely a highlight. Instead of just reading about motherboards, RAM, and processors in slides, we actually got to install them ourselves. This hands-on experience helped me understand computer architecture in a way that lectures alone couldn't match. Watching everything come together and power up for the first time was genuinely exciting.

**🏢 Pittsburgh Paint Company (PPG) Industry Engagement**  
The PPG industry talk really connected classroom theory with workplace reality. Hearing professionals talk about the actual skills employers are looking for and the challenges they deal with daily helped me figure out which competencies I should focus on developing. It was refreshing to hear about career paths from people who are actually in the field, not just from textbooks.

**💼 Serunai Professional Development Session**  
This session cleared up a lot about the Software Development Life Cycle and Agile frameworks. Understanding how development teams iterate, adapt to changing requirements, and deliver projects incrementally gave me good insight into real-world software engineering practices. It showed me that building systems isn't just about writing code. It's equally about having good processes, teamwork, and being able to improve continuously.

## 🌟 Moving Forward

### What I Value Most

The balance between theory and practical applications made this course particularly effective. Topics like network security and cloud computing aren't just academic concepts, they're technologies I'll be working with throughout my career. Learning about privacy and ethics also reminded me that technical skills need to be guided by responsibility and integrity.

### Enhancement Opportunities

While the course content was comprehensive, I think future students would benefit from:
- More lab sessions focused on networking and database design
- Additional case studies analyzing both system failures and successes
- Guest lectures from different IT sectors (not just manufacturing)
- Group projects that simulate real system implementation scenarios

## 💭 Final Perspective

SECP1513 has given me a solid understanding of the IT landscape that's essential for any computer science professional. As someone focusing on data engineering, this course helped me see how my future specialty fits within larger organizational systems. I now understand that effective data engineers need to know more than just data pipelines, they also need to understand the hardware running them, the networks transmitting data, and the security measures protecting it.

This broader perspective will definitely guide my continued learning and professional development.
