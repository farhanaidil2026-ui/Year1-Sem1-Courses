## 🎯 Course Impact

### Academic Growth

This course transformed my understanding of how technology ecosystems function in professional environments. Learning about databases and data analytics particularly resonated with my data engineering aspirations—I now see how proper data architecture forms the foundation for meaningful analysis. The system design principles taught me to think holistically about how different IT components interact to solve business problems.

### Memorable Experiences

**🔧 PC Assembly Workshop**  
The hands-on PC assembly lab was a highlight. Instead of just reading about motherboards, RAM, and processors, I actually installed them. This tactile experience solidified my understanding of computer architecture in a way lectures alone couldn't achieve. Seeing how each component fits together and powers up for the first time was genuinely exciting.

**🏢 Pittsburgh Paint Company (PPG) Industry Engagement**  
The PPG industry talk bridged the gap between classroom theory and workplace reality. Hearing professionals discuss the actual skills employers value and the challenges they face daily gave me clarity on which competencies to prioritize. It was refreshing to learn about career trajectories from people living them, not just from course materials.

**💼 Serunai Professional Development Session**  
This session demystified the Software Development Life Cycle and Agile frameworks. Understanding how development teams iterate, adapt to changing requirements, and deliver projects incrementally gave me insight into real-world software engineering practices. It showed me that building systems isn't just about coding—it's about process, collaboration, and continuous improvement.

## 🌟 Moving Forward

### What I Value Most

The balance between theoretical foundations and practical applications made this course particularly effective. Topics like network security and cloud computing aren't just academic concepts—they're technologies I'll interact with throughout my career. Understanding privacy and ethics also reminded me that technical skills must be guided by responsibility and integrity.

### Enhancement Opportunities

While the course content was comprehensive, I believe future students would benefit from:
- Additional lab sessions for networking and database design
- More case studies analyzing system failures and successes
- Guest lectures from various IT sectors (beyond manufacturing)
- Group projects simulating real system implementation scenarios

## 💭 Final Perspective

SECP1513 has equipped me with a broad understanding of the IT landscape essential for any computer science professional. As someone focusing on data engineering, this course helped me appreciate how my future specialty fits within larger organizational systems. I now recognize that effective data engineers must understand not just data pipelines, but the hardware running them, the networks transmitting data, and the security protecting it.

This holistic view will guide my continued learning and professional development.
